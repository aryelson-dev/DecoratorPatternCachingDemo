# DecoratorPatternCachingDemo
A simple Decorator Pattern Caching DEMO. In this Demo you can see one good way to implement a powerful and important pattern: the DECORATOR PATTERN.
Builded in .NET 7, the project has a Web Api with a simple controller.
The project's objective is use de DECORATOR PATTERN to resolve this problem: alter de Repository behavior, adding a data source cache, without change the 
original repository or other existent class.
The solution was to implement DECORATOR PATTERN to apply the required behavior. So the first API call, access the original data source, and other API calls 
gets data into memory cache.
I hope help you understand this pattern and solve your issues!
